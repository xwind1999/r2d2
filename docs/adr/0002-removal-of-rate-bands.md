# 2. Removal of Rate Bands

Date: 2020-05-08

## Status

Accepted

## Context

Given we won't use Rate Bands any time soon, and it would only add complexity to our code, we decided to remove it.

## Decision

Rate bands will be removed for now.

## Consequences

In the future, whenever we need the rate bands, we can go back to this commit and redo the work. Of course, it won't be 
easy, but it shouldn't be hard either.
