# Architecture Decision Records

> Architecture Decision Records (ADR) is a technique for capturing important architectural decisions, along with their context and consequences as described by [Michael Nygard](https://twitter.com/mtnygard) in his article: [Documenting Architecture Decisions](http://thinkrelevance.com/blog/2011/11/15/documenting-architecture-decisions).

## Create a new ADR

```
./vendor/bin/phpadr make:decision <title> --config=phpadr.yaml
```
