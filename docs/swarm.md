# Docker Swarm

We decided to use Docker Swarm to make our deploys easier, and also to easily scale the number of the specialised workers.



## Setting up the Swarm

##### Manager or worker?

In Docker Swarm, we have two types of nodes: _manager_ and _worker_.
 
Manager nodes can modify the status of the swarm, and worker nodes can't.

For R2D2, we'll use the __node 01__ as a manager. Eventually, when we increase the number of nodes we have,
we may need to add more managers, but _we must always keep it an odd number_.


##### Setting up the manager
On the manager node (any node), you need to run
```shell
$ docker swarm init
```

This command will output the following:
```
Swarm initialized: current node (tuewqewsl9wcm40dgdrdi11a2) is now a manager.

To add a worker to this swarm, run the following command:

    docker swarm join --token SWMTKN-1-1wng5xiso8emqtdxbjhtd6gz9lqg9wprqm6js5ohczhc6mjxc6-7zy88eytobd61gohrkk6sxye1 10.29.21.62:2377

To add a manager to this swarm, run 'docker swarm join-token manager' and follow the instructions.
```

This command outputted is what you'll need to run in the other nodes to add it to the swarm. Go to the other nodes and run it.

##### Setting up the workers
```
$ docker swarm join --token SWMTKN-1-1wng5xiso8emqtdxbjhtd6gz9lqg9wprqm6js5ohczhc6mjxc6-7zy88eytobd61gohrkk6sxye1 10.29.21.62:2377
This node joined a swarm as a worker.
```

Do this to all nodes in the environment, and the swarm is ready to be used!

## Managing replicas

By default, swarm starts only a single container for each service listed in docker-compose.yaml.
To set up the number of replicas to be spun up, you need to set it in the docker-compose:

```yaml
version: '3.4'

services:
  api:
    image: any_image:any-version
    deploy:
      replicas: 2
```
The replicas will be spun up across all swarm nodes.

For API (public-facing) containers, you need to spin up a number of replicas equal to the numbers of node you have.

## Scaling the number of workers

This needs to be run in a manager node:

```shell
$ docker service scale r2d2_worker-broadcast-listeners-price-information=4
``` 
``` 
r2d2_worker-broadcast-listeners-price-information scaled to 4
overall progress: 4 out of 4 tasks 
1/4: running   [==================================================>] 
2/4: running   [==================================================>] 
3/4: running   [==================================================>] 
4/4: running   [==================================================>] 
verify: Service converged 
```

Replicas will be spread across the swarm cluster.

## Visualising the swarm services

You can see all the services deployed in a swarm, with the amount of live replicas by issuing the following command:

```shell
$ docker service ls
```
```

## Publishing ports

Differently from regular deploys, deploying with swarm means we need to explictly tell it which ports to expose,
and which ways to expose it.

```yaml
version: '3.4'

services:
  api:
    image: any_image:any-version
    deploy:
      replicas: 4
    ports:
      - target: 80
        published: 80
        protocol: tcp
        mode: ingress
``` 
The key `mode: ingress` here means that it will use swarm ingress to load-balance traffic between nodes. If we were to
use host, we would be able to spin up only one api container per node.

## Blue-green deployment

In R2D2 swarm, we enabled blue-green deployment for the api nodes. To do that, you need to tell docker to start
the containers after updating the service definition. That can be done with the following snippet in docker-compose.yaml:
  
```yaml
version: '3.4'

services:
  api:
    image: any_image:any-version
    deploy:
      replicas: 2
      update_config:
        order: start-first
```
Values for `update_config.order` can be `start-first` or `stop-first`.

 * _stop-first:_ traditional deploy - stop the containers and then spin up the new ones
 * _start-first_ blue-green deployment - stop the containers only after spinning up the new ones

## Managing secrets

We're using vault for storing secrets. All keys in vault will be exposed to the containers
as environment variables, replacing the need for the `.env` file.

Please note we won't pull any files from vault, only the keys and values.

## Deploying

Deploy to a swarm uses the docker CLI connecting to a remote host, defined by the DOCKER_HOST environment variable.

```shell
DOCKER_HOST=ssh://my-production-node.smartbox.com docker stack deploy --compose-file my-docker-compose-file.yaml my-service
```
The variable `DOCKER_HOST` must point to a swarm manager node, and it will flow to the other nodes from there.
There's no need to deploy to any other node. 

## Re-building the swarm

If everything goes wrong, we can always rebuild the entire swarm, and redeploy the application.
For that, please make sure no nodes are present on the swarm, by making each of them leave it:
```shell
$ docker swarm leave --force
```
Then, setting up following the steps on [Setting up the Swarm](#setting-up-the-swarm).

After it's rebuild, you can run the deploy again.


## Troubleshooting

1. _A node was somehow removed from the swarm. What should I do?_

    You can re-add the node to the swarm by running the swarm join command. To retrieve it, go to the swarm master
    and run the following command:
    ```shell
    $ docker swarm join-token worker
    ```
   
   It will generate the worker join command that you need to run in your node. Please refer to
   [Setting up the manager](#setting-up-the-manager) and [Setting up the workers](#setting-up-the-workers).
 
2. _Can't access the API docs when connecting directly to the nodes!_

   Check if the API containers are up, and with the port 80 exposed:
   
    ```shell
    $ docker stack ps r2d2
    ```
   ```

   ```
   
   If they are up, the easiest way to fix it would be redeploying it, or, as a last resort, re-building the swarm. 
 
3. _Deploy is not working! Looks like the vault token expired!_

   You can ask someone from Platform Engineering to generate a new vault key for you, and update it
   on GitLab CI Variables (`MOBY_VAULT_TOKEN` for moby token, and `VAULT_APP_TOKEN` for the app secrets token)
   
4. _Looks like vault is down!_

   _Oh, well..._
